# Pathfinding Visualizer

An **interactive Python visualizer** for common pathfinding algorithms on a 2D grid.  
This project demonstrates how BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, and Bidirectional Search explore a grid and find paths from a start to a target cell.

## Features

- Visualizes the exploration of algorithms step by step using `matplotlib`.
- Supports multiple algorithms:
  - **BFS** – Breadth-First Search
  - **DFS** – Depth-First Search
  - **UCS** – Uniform Cost Search
  - **DLS** – Depth-Limited Search
  - **IDDFS** – Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search
  - **Bidirectional Search**
- Highlights:
  - Start (`S`) and Target (`T`) cells
  - Walls (`-1`)
  - Frontier cells (cyan)
  - Explored cells (yellow)
  - Final Path (purple)
- Adjustable depth limit for DLS and IDDFS.
